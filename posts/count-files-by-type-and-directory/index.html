			<p>I have been working on updating a 15 year old data collection / ETL process in the last weeks. As part of the planning process, I wanted to know how many people are using the data we collect<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. Sure, I could <em>ask</em> people, but how does that help me sharpen my skills a Data Wizard<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>At my work, our shared server is organized by analyst (i.e. each of the subfolders to the team&rsquo;s main directory is the name of an employee). Since our data is stored in a SQL database and you need to write a query to get the data, I can get a quick and dirty look at who is using this data and how often. I can simply look in everybody&rsquo;s folder for <code>.sql</code> files that contain a distinct word or phrase that will identify my database.</p>
<p>To do this efficiently at the command line, I used a couple of built in bash functions (<code>awk</code>, <code>sort</code> and <code>uniq</code>) and the speedy version of another: <code>ripgrep</code> (<code>grep</code>). They aren&rsquo;t exactly faster versions as they don&rsquo;t mimic the behavior of the built-ins, but they accomplish many of the same tasks. Most importantly for me, it means I can do this task without having to wait around for a day for my code to run.</p>
<p>The basic procedure is the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Search through each directory for <code>.sql</code> files.</li>
<li>Check whether those files contain the pattern I am looking for.</li>
<li>If so, add the file path to my list.</li>
<li>(optional) Save the list to a file.</li>
<li>Split the file paths to get just the names of people who have used the data and saved their query.</li>
<li>Sort and count the number of files.</li>
</ol>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to do this in two lines which could be chained together using <code>xargs</code> (also left to the reader) or made into a function. I may consider the latter if it turns out to be something useful down the line as well. The first command I used makes a list of all the files I am interested in and save it as the text file <code>MyQueries.txt</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#93a1a1;background-color:#002b36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback">rg &#39;dbo.CoolTable&#39; -g &#39;!BadDirectory/*&#39; -g &#39;*.sql&#39; -l -i &gt; /Path/to/MyQueries.txt
</code></pre></div><p>Here&rsquo;s what each part of that command does:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>rg 'dbo.CoolTable'</code>: uses ripgrep to search for <code>dbo.CoolTable</code>. The pattern you give is a regular expression (unless you speccify otherwise with the <code>-F</code> or <code>--fixed-strings</code> flag), so you can as fancy as you want with your regex.</li>
<li><code>-g '!BadDirectory/*'</code>: this is the glob command which allows you to tell ripgrep what directories to look in or avoid in its search. The <code>!</code> in front of the directory name tells ripgrep to exclude that directory. Glob flags can be used more than once (which brings us to our next piece):</li>
<li><code>-g '*.sql'</code>: another glob flag to search only for SQL files. This can also be specified with the <code>--type</code> (<code>-t</code>) flag and the file type you are interested in (<code>sql</code> in my case). I went this route because the latter flag wasn&rsquo;t working for me.</li>
<li><code>-l -i</code>: <code>-l</code> (<code>--files-with-matches</code>) returns the file path where at least one match was found and <code>-i</code> (<code>--ignore-case</code>) makes your pattern search case insensitive. Since SQL is case-insensitive, using this means I&rsquo;ll get files where people use <code>dbo.cooltable</code>, <code>DBO.COOLTABLE</code> and everything in between.</li>
<li><code>&gt; /Path/to/MyQueries.txt</code>: finally I redirect the output from ripgrep to the textfile which I will analyze with my next command.</li>
</ul>
<p>The second command takes the list of files I found, parses it for my colleagues' names and counts how many files there are in each of their directories:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#93a1a1;background-color:#002b36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback">awk -F &#34;/&#34; &#39;{print $1}&#39; /Path/to/MyQueries.txt | sort | uniq -c &gt; query-count.txt
</code></pre></div><p>Awk is actually its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AWK">very own programming language</a> (!) that is mostly used for extracting data from text. There is a whole lot to it, so if you are interested, go spend the day <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/gawk.html">on the documentation</a>. All I&rsquo;m going to do for you here is explain my little command :). Again, bit by bit:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>awk -F &quot;/&quot;</code>: calls awk and specifies a delimiter to use to parse your data. Since I am dealing with file paths, I use the forward (or is it backward?) slash.</li>
<li><code>'{print $1}'</code> tells awk to return the first element of my parsed line. Since the file paths I have in my file go something like <code>NameOfColleague/subdir/*/sql_file.sql</code> with the name of my coworker always in the first position, this gives me one instance of each person&rsquo;s name for each query they have written to my database.</li>
<li><code>/Path/to/MyQueries.txt</code>: tells <code>awk</code> what file to operate on.</li>
<li><code>| sort | uniq -c</code>: finally, the resulting list of names is sorted and counted! What I really want only the number of times each name appears in my list, so you would think <code>sort</code> wouldn&rsquo;t be necessary. However, <code>uniq</code> only detects repeats in <em>adjacent</em> lines, so the list has to be sorted with the <code>sort</code> command before passing it to <code>uniq</code>. <code>-c</code> tells <code>uniq</code> to return a count of unique occurences it finds.</li>
</ul>
<p>And there you have it! A long explanation of a short series of commands that will give you the number of files that contain a text snippet of interest, grouped by directory.</p>

<p>I also want to know which features folks are using which I may also try to do at the command line, but <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/physicsmemes/comments/8wil0z/the_meme_is_left_as_an_exercise_for_the_reader/">that exercise is currently left to the reader</a>. <a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>I am just kidding here in case you were wondering. Usually talking to people gets us to the answer to a question like this much more quickly and effectively than any silly computer wizardry. <a href="#fnref:2" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
